<td align="justify">During my 3rd semester break of Diploma, I have to do practical to pass my subject of Library Fieldwork. I went to Perpustakaan Ibnu Khaldun in Politeknik Premier Shah Alam. The practical runs for 6 weeks from 13 January until 20 February. The moment that I really canâ€™t forget is that on the second day, it is our first time to teach in information literacy class and then we have to teach deaf student. It is quite difficult but in the same time it is very fun.</td>
